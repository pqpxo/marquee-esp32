# Changelog

## 2.2.1-esp32-enhanced.4 — 2026-08-17

- Split Street's bulb-lit poster frame and NOW PLAYING sign out of the baked
  scene so each can be moved, resized, scaled, recoloured, removed, and added
  independently in Design while preserving the original default composition.
- Added a bounded, centered title-logo viewport with automatic transparent-edge
  trimming, contain/width/natural fit modes, and a 50–200% logo zoom control.
- Kept existing Street layouts migration-free: older settings inherit the new
  movable decorations at their original positions.

## 2.2.1-esp32-enhanced.3 — 2026-08-17

- Added target-display preview sizes with CrowPanel 800×480 as the default,
  presets for Google Nest Hub and Nest Hub Max, common 16:9/4:3 sizes, and
  validated custom dimensions.
- Added an option to show or hide the Device block's live Local/Remote label.
- Added an opt-in Active streams block backed by the media server's current
  movie/episode session count.
- Added a dedicated Street rain/storm animation switch.
- Made Credits Badge removable and addable through the standard Design chips.

## 2.2.1-esp32-enhanced.2 — 2026-08-16

- Standardized Viewer, Device, Stream, and Audio & subtitles cards to the same
  height, with independent per-block background and border switches.
- Split the former composite Title block into separately movable Category and
  Title blocks while retaining title-logo behaviour and old settings migration.
- Expanded the per-block font picker to fifteen named fonts plus theme default.
- Added persistent custom-backdrop upload with cover/contain/stretch, zoom,
  horizontal/vertical focus, opacity, blur, and brightness controls.
- Updated `marquee-shot` to refresh immediately after any saved design or
  custom-backdrop change, as well as playback/session changes.

## 2.2.1-esp32-enhanced.1 — 2026-08-16

- Added opt-in Viewer, Device, Stream, and Audio & subtitles Designer blocks.
- Normalized Plex, Emby, and Jellyfin session, playback-path, HDR, bitrate,
  audio, and subtitle data into the shared `now-playing.json` payload.
- Added eligible-session position/count so a card can show which viewer is
  currently selected during rotation.
- Updated `marquee-shot` to capture immediately when viewer, device, stream,
  or track metadata changes, so ESPHome panels do not show stale details.
- Preserved the ESP32 fork's panel-sized backdrop and logo image variants.

## 2.2.1 — 2026-08-02

- **Fanart rotation now floors at 5 minutes** (up to 60), picked from a
  dropdown — the Hub is ambient, not a slideshow. The settings preview still
  rotates fast so you can see it working.
- **Weather only runs where it shows.** A weather block on one template no
  longer keeps the weather fetch alive on every other template.
- **Fixed: chips now see the card's edges.** A block dragged off the edge
  reported as visible; now it ghosts its chip the moment it leaves the frame,
  and truth updates on every slider move instead of waiting for a re-render.

## 2.2.0 — 2026-08-02

- **New: Fanart template.** Rotating fanart.tv artwork for whatever's
  playing — backgrounds by default, or posters, logos, clear art, banners,
  thumbs — crossfading on a timer you set. It starts empty on purpose: add
  only the blocks you want over the art. Tap the background for art type and
  speed; paste a free fanart.tv API key on the Connection tab (stored
  server-side, write-only, like every key).
- **New: fog is real smoke.** Rising particle smoke replaces the old flat
  haze (technique by dburrell, credited), and fixing it uncovered a
  frame-rate bug foggy weather had always carried — gone.
- **New: try any weather.** The Weather editor previews rain, snow, storm,
  fog, cloudy, and day/night on demand. Preview only; never saved.
- **Fixed: adding a block always shows it.** Some combos (Metadata on Big
  Clock, Plot on Hero and Lower Third…) silently never appeared. Chips also
  now verify a block really painted before claiming it's on screen.

## 2.1.0 — 2026-08-01

- **New: share your look.** "Share this look" exports your setup as a small
  credited file; anyone importing it gets it on their carousel as a preset
  "by you", one tap from applied. Credentials and location never ride along.
- **New: honest chips.** A block that's on your card but has nothing to show
  for the current title goes dim and dashed, and the editor says so —
  instead of letting you drag sliders at nothing.
- **New: About credits + support.** Contributors, catt, and the CodePen
  artists behind the weather are named — plus an optional Buy Me a Coffee
  button.
- What's new renders as release cards now instead of a wall of text.

## 2.0.0 — 2026-08-01

Settings v2: the card fills the page and you edit what you're looking at.

- **New: tap-to-edit.** Tap any block on the live preview — or the card's
  background — and only that block's controls appear: font, per-block color
  (new), position, size, and its own settings.
- **New: presets.** Snapshot your current look onto the template carousel;
  Export backs presets up.
- **New: block chips.** One pill per block on the card — tap to edit,
  × to remove, "+ Add" brings anything back.
- **New: a six-step guided tour**, once, on first run — and a phone layout
  where the preview pins to the top so the keyboard can never cover it.
- **Removed:** the vibes/theme rows (per-block color replaces them; saved
  themes keep tinting until you recolor), card-wide font rows, and poster
  side. Every old save and export still imports cleanly.

## 1.12.2 — 2026-08-01

- Real design work on the only page we have: the card-content toggle wall is
  now a light board — every card element is a bulb chip, lit amber when it's
  on the card, dim glass when off. Fourteen full-width switch rows became
  three rows of chips, with the clock and weather fine-tuning grouped
  beneath them, still gated by their chips.
- Tapping a block on the preview flashes its chip, so on/off and
  place-and-size always point at each other.

## 1.12.1 — 2026-08-01

- Course correction on the editor idea: nothing hides anymore. Every option
  is on the page, organized under sticky section chips (Template · Look ·
  Card · Connection); tapping a region of the card now scrolls its controls
  into view and flashes them instead of swapping panes.
- The preview is a small monitor — sticky top-right on desktop, and back in
  the bottom sheet on phones (the pattern that worked), sized down so the
  controls keep the room.

## 1.12.0 — 2026-07-31

- The settings page is now an editor: the card fills the page and is the
  navigation. Tap anything on it — the poster, the plot, the clock — and just
  that thing's controls appear in the inspector rail. Look (templates, vibes,
  theme, fonts) is the rail's home; server, casting, filters, and
  export/import live behind Connection & casting in the top bar.
- Save moved to the top bar, always in reach; on phones the card rides sticky
  at the top while the inspector scrolls beneath it.
- Nothing about the card or the saved settings changed — same keys, same
  save flow, same instant preview.

## 1.11.4 — 2026-07-31

- The settings page now looks like the product it controls: the masthead is a
  letterboard between two bulb rails in the card's own Bebas Neue, section
  titles speak the same face, toggles glow amber when lit, the preview sits in
  a real screen bezel that spills a little light, and the marquee's glow pools
  down from the top of the page.

## 1.11.3 — 2026-07-31

- Settings page pass: Card content rows are grouped now — Clock style and
  seconds sit under the Clock toggle, weather intensity/ZIP/units under the
  weather toggles, and controls whose parent is off dim and disable instead
  of silently doing nothing.
- The preview leads: on desktop the demo card now sits right under Save with
  the block editor folded beneath it (tap a block to unfold it, same as
  phones), so the preview is always in view instead of below an open editor.
- Panel headings got a size bump and a hairline rule — the long page scans.

## 1.11.2 — 2026-07-22

- The card now accepts a `?tpl=<template>` query param to preview any
  template without changing saved settings — so a demo link like
  `/image?demo=1&tpl=street&wx=rain&day=0` always shows the Street scene and
  weather regardless of which template is saved. View it on a wide/landscape
  screen; the card is designed for the Hub's 16:9 display.

## 1.11.1 — 2026-07-22

- Fixed the now-playing card requesting a missing `/favicon.ico` (a harmless
  404 and console error). The card now carries the same tab icon as the
  settings page.

## 1.11.0 — 2026-07-22

### Street weather, rebuilt for real

The live weather on the Street scene got a full realism pass, built around
techniques from four community CodePens (credited in `CREDITS.md`):

- **Rain and snow now draw on a `<canvas>`** — real particles, not CSS
  tiles. Rain streaks vary in length with fall speed and kick up splash
  droplets when they land, coloured near‑white rather than blue. Snow is
  150 flakes with random size, speed, and wind drift — no repeating grid.
- **Fog** is three soft layers drifting at different speeds with
  independently pulsing opacity under a blur — a real rolling haze instead
  of a flat wash.
- **Overcast** casts a slow drifting cloud shadow instead of flat dimming.
- **Thunderstorms** (`?wx=storm`) are their own condition with denser rain
  and stronger dimming.
- **The "NOW PLAYING" sign glows like neon** with an irregular flicker,
  theme‑tinted, resting in daylight.

The canvas only runs while rain/snow/storm is active and stops otherwise,
so it costs nothing on a clear day.

**Weather effects are now their own setting** — **Weather effects** under
Card content, separate from the **Weather** text chip. You can have the
temperature readout without the scene effects, or the effects without the
readout; neither is tied to the other. On by default so Street keeps its
signature look.

**Effect intensity (1–4)** — a new dropdown under Card content scales how
strong the weather looks: particle count, particle opacity, and fog/cloud
density. Defaults to **2 (Light)**, which stays easy to ignore if the
screen sits in the corner of your eye while you watch something.

Test any condition live with `?wx=rain|snow|fog|cloud|storm`, `?day=1|0`,
and `?wxi=1..4` on `/image`.

## 1.10.0 — 2026-07-21

### Mix and match any block, on any template

The block editor's "Selected block" dropdown now only ever lists what's
actually on the current template. A new **Add a block** control sits next
to it: pick a name and it's placed on the template immediately (auto-slotted
onto an open spot, ready to drag), then resets itself so it's always ready
for the next one. A **Remove block** button drops the selected block back
off. Every template ships with its original block set untouched — this is
purely additive, so nothing changes until you actually add or remove
something. **Reset this template** now restores the template's shipped
block set too, not just positions.

Weather is no longer nested inside the clock block sharing its position —
it's its own block, sized and placed independently. Adding it also turns
its data fetch on if it wasn't already (that one setting used to default
off, unlike everything else you can add).

Every block change is scoped to the template you're looking at: nudging a
block's position on Spotlight no longer silently nudges it on Street too,
the way it used to.

### The mobile settings page gets a top strip instead of a wall of cards

On phones, the Template grid and the inline Vibes stepper — two overlapping
ways to pick mostly the same thing — collapse into one looping, swipeable
carousel pinned under the header. Swipe through and the preview updates
live, the same way Vibes always has; tap a card or let it settle and it's
applied. Frees up most of a screen's worth of vertical space before you
even reach a real control.

Also on phones: a focused text field elsewhere on the page popping the
keyboard used to leave the fixed preview sheet pinned across most of the
little space the keyboard left, crushing whatever you were trying to type
into down to a sliver. The sheet now gets out of the way while a keyboard's
up — nothing in it needs one.

### Real weather on the Street scene

Street's brick wall now reacts to actual conditions: rain streaks, drifting
snow, or overcast dimming, plus true day/night — daylight brightens the
wall and rests the marquee's bulb-twinkle and sign-chase animations instead
of running them under a bright sky. Same `/weather` endpoint every template
already used for the weather chip; Street just also fetches it for itself
when you haven't turned the chip on. `?wx=rain|snow|fog|cloud` and
`?day=1|0` force a condition, for testing without waiting for the sky to
cooperate.

The poster also picked up a theme-colored glow bleeding onto the brick
behind it, like backlighting through the marquee case — it retints with
whichever accent color the card is using, the same as the progress bar and
title glow already do.

## 1.9.0 — 2026-07-20

### A "do not cast" list, so the marquee can't overshare

A new **Do not cast** filter: comma-separated words, checked against every
session's genres, tags, and content rating. A match means that session is
never cast — no title, no poster, no card. Set it as `BLOCK_TAGS` in the
container or type it on the settings page (same default-vs-override rule as
the other filters, with the env value shown as a greyed placeholder).
`adult, xxx, 18+, nc-17, tv-ma` is the obvious use, but it's just words —
block `horror` on the family display if you like.

Matching is deliberately broad: case-insensitive, and words of three or more
characters match inside terms, so `adult` also blocks an "Adult Animation"
genre — for an overshare guard, blocking too much beats leaking. Shorter
words match a term exactly, so blocking the `R` rating doesn't take Horror
and Drama with it. On Emby/Jellyfin, where `/Sessions`
sometimes omits the genre list, the picked item is re-checked after its full
record is fetched: better a blank display than a title the pre-filter
couldn't see. Blocked sessions still appear in the settings page's Active
sessions list (marked not allowed), so the admin can see the filter doing
its job.

### Env vars are defaults you can see, not overrides you can't

`PLEX_USERS` / `PLEX_DEVICES` used to **merge** with the settings page instead
of being replaced by it. The env list was invisible — the Users field showed
empty while every other session was silently ignored — and unliftable: the
page could only add names to what the env var already allowed, so clearing the
field changed nothing. `HUB_IP` alone behaved correctly.

Now all three follow `HUB_IP`'s rule: a typed value replaces the env var, a
blank field inherits it. The inherited value is shown as a greyed placeholder —
`jamison (from PLEX_USERS)` — via a new `/env-defaults` route that serves
exactly those three values and nothing else, an allowlist so nothing
credential-shaped can leak to a browser by default. `selftest` pins the
override semantics (blank inherits, typed replaces, the env is never unioned
back in) and the allowlist (no token/key-shaped name may ever join the hints).

The Emby/Jellyfin session picker now uses that same `filter_set` resolution —
previously only the Plex path did, so on an Emby backend the user/device fields
still merged with the env var (invisible, unliftable) while the docs promised
they replaced it. Both backends read the same settings fields, so both now
behave identically; `selftest` drives `emby_current_session()` to prove a typed
user list excludes an env-allowed user rather than unioning it in.

### Emby and Jellyfin join Plex

Marquee can now watch an Emby or Jellyfin server instead of Plex. Set
`MEDIA_BACKEND=emby` (with `EMBY_HOST` / `EMBY_API_KEY`) or
`MEDIA_BACKEND=jellyfin` (with `JELLYFIN_HOST` / `JELLYFIN_API_KEY`); Plex
stays the default and the Plex path is untouched.

Both backends produce the same now-playing dict, so every template, theme,
toggle, and the session filters and rotation work identically — the selftest
asserts the two parsers emit the same keys. Emby's `/Sessions` omits some of
the fields the card wants (genres, media streams, ratings, overview), so the
backend fetches them from `/Items` once per title and caches them, exactly as
the Plex path caches its metadata lookups. Artwork (poster, backdrop, logo)
comes from the item image endpoints at the same sizes the Plex transcoder
delivers.

Jellyfin forked from Emby in 2018 and the handful of APIs Marquee uses —
`api_key` query auth, `/Sessions`, `/Items`, `/Items/{id}/Images/*` — are
byte-compatible, so Jellyfin rides the Emby code path unchanged. The
`JELLYFIN_*` env names are aliases for the `EMBY_*` pair, accepted so a
compose file can say what it means. Verified end to end against live Emby and
Jellyfin (10.11) servers, through to the card rendering on a real Nest Hub.

### Switch backends from the settings page

A new **Media server** panel picks the backend: one dropdown (Plex / Emby /
Jellyfin), one server-address field, one key field. The dropdown decides
which backend the two fields edit; each backend keeps its own stored pair,
so switching between servers loses nothing. Like every other setting,
nothing changes until **Save**; the choice is then resolved every poll, so a
saved change takes effect within ~5 seconds — no container restart. The
settings page wins and env is the container-level default, exactly the rule
the cast device field has always followed; with nothing set anywhere, the
backend is plex, as it has always been.

Keys and tokens are write-only secrets: stored server-side, never served
back to a browser. `/settings.json` replaces each with a saved/not-saved
hint, the page shows *saved — blank keeps it*, and Export/Import never
carries them. Saving a backend that has no server configured anywhere is
rejected with a clear error rather than stored — a backend that fails
silently on the next poll would just be a blank display with no explanation.

With that, only `PAGE_URL` is required at startup. A container with no
media-server credentials at all no longer exits; it warns and serves the
settings page, where the server address and key finish the job. Every
credential env var still works exactly as before — it is simply no longer
the only way in.

## 1.8.0 — 2026-07-19

### The block editor grows up

- **Font per block**: a Block font picker next to Selected block. The clock,
  progress bar, plot — any block — can now carry its own face; Theme default
  keeps the card-wide fonts. Title & logo blocks apply it to the text title
  too.
- **Snap to grid**: get a block close, hit the button, and its top-left corner
  lands on the nearest line of the grid you already see while editing
  (every 2.5% of the screen).
- **Justify tells the truth**: Left/Center/Right now aligns the logo image and
  the plain-text title the same way, in every template. Before, templates that
  center the title block (Hero, Big Clock) kept centering the *logo* while the
  text obeyed your choice — so a movie without a clear-logo drew its title
  off-center from where the logo had been.
- The editor also no longer writes `align: left` into your layout the first
  time you touch a slider — that silent write was how most off-center titles
  happened. No Justify button lights up until you actually pick one.

### Phones stopped fighting you

The preview, the block controls, and Save now ride together in one fixed
bottom sheet. Scrolling the settings page can't graze a slider and skew a
block, Save is always next to what you're previewing, and tapping a block in
the preview unfolds the editor right above it. On desktop nothing moved —
the editor just gained the same Snap button and font picker, and folds away
if you want it gone.

## 1.7.0 — 2026-07-14

### The Hub no longer sits on a blank screen

Marquee decided whether to cast by asking the Hub whether the DashCast app was
loaded. That answers the wrong question: a Hub whose card page has died — it
crashed, reloaded into nothing, or was left holding a stale page — keeps
reporting DashCast forever. Marquee concluded the card was already up and did
nothing, silently, while the display showed nothing. There was no error, and
nothing in the log.

The card fetches `/now-playing.json` every `POLL_SECONDS`, so the server already
knew whether the page was alive; it just wasn't looking. That fetch is now
timestamped, and a card silent for longer than 45 seconds is treated as gone and
re-cast. A page cast moments ago gets one window to load before it counts.

`/healthz` reports `cardPollAgo`, `cardAlive`, and `cardGrace`, so a display
showing a dead page is now visible from outside the container — which matters,
because per-request logging is suppressed.

### More than one person is watching

When two people stream at once, the card used to flip between their titles at
random. `/status/sessions` has no defined order, Plex reorders it as sessions
come and go, and Marquee took whichever session happened to be listed first —
re-deciding every poll.

Sessions are now sorted by user, then device, then title, so the choice is
stable. When more than one allowed session is playing, each takes the display
in turn: a new **Rotate between sessions** setting, 30 seconds by default. Set
it to 0 to pin the first one instead.

Rotation is a pure function of the clock, so nothing needs to be remembered
across a restart, and two displays watching the same server show the same
session at the same time. Your user and device filters still decide who is
eligible — rotation only orders whoever is left, so filtering to yourself with
two devices rotates rather than flickering.

## 1.6.0 — 2026-07-09

### Share your look

- **Export / Import**: two buttons next to Save. Export copies your whole
  setup as text; Import pastes someone else's and applies it (your cast
  device stays yours). Post your look, let people steal it.

### Mobile

- The settings page works properly on phones now — no more sideways
  overflow — and the **live preview rides the bottom of the screen**, so
  stepping vibes, flipping toggles, and changing fonts is always visible
  while you scroll the controls.

### Type

- **Card font** joins Title font: pick a face for everything else — plot,
  metadata, clock. Per-element size still lives on the block editor's
  Size slider.

### Odds & ends

- Street's pay phone is retired.
- `?demo=N` pins a demo film again (and holds through the rotation timer).
- README leads with a variety collage and real-library screenshots.

## 1.4.0 — 2026-07-08

### Session filters

- New "Who triggers the marquee" section in settings: limit casting to
  specific Plex **users** and **devices**, editable live — no container
  restart. Empty fields keep the old behavior (everyone, any device), so a
  shared user's stream — or your own phone away from home — no longer takes
  over the Hub.
- An "Active sessions" check shows exactly who is playing what on which
  device, with the exact names to copy into the filters, and flags sessions
  the current filters exclude.
- `PLEX_DEVICES` env var joins `PLEX_USERS` as a container-level fallback;
  both merge with the settings-page lists.

### Demo reel

- The single demo movie is now a four-film reel of original fictional
  comedies — *Shaking Hands & Kissing Babies* (campaign-poster style),
  *Rat King III: Still Gnawing* (graffiti stencil), *Participation Trophy*
  (sticker bomb), and *B-Sides* (vinyl sleeve). Each has hand-built vector
  poster, backdrop, and logo art; the preview picks one at random per load,
  and pure demo mode (`/image?demo`) rotates every 20 seconds.
  `?demo=N` pins a film. Roughly 70KB lighter than the old embedded art.

### Street template & vibes

- New **Street** template: a living night scene — brick wall, pay phone,
  and your poster hanging in a bulb-lit **NOW PLAYING** marquee frame. The
  clear-logo (or title) reads as spray-painted onto the brick, grain and all.
  The lighting is alive: marquee bulbs twinkle on their own phases, the sign
  bulbs chase, the neon flickers now and then, the street-lamp pool breathes,
  and the marquee trim re-lights in your theme's accent. Honors
  prefers-reduced-motion.
- Four new themes named for the demo reel: **Campaign** (navy & red tape),
  **Concrete** (back-alley gold), **Trophy** (gold-star yellow), and
  **B-Sides** (dollar-bin orange).
- **Vibes**: one-tap presets bundling theme + font + template — Campaign
  Trail, Back Alley, Gold Star, Dollar Bin, Simulation ("we're all just
  programming ourselves"), and Third Act ("the universe is on its final
  reel"). Tap one, tweak, save.

### Preview & accent

- Changing the title font now previews instantly even when a clear-logo is
  shown: the card swaps in the text title for a few seconds so you can see
  the font.
- A custom accent color now tints as deeply as the built-in themes: metadata
  chip borders and the progress track pick it up too.
- The Big Clock template's clock now glows in the accent color.

## 1.3.0 — 2026-07-07

### Layout & type

- Every block can now be justified left, center, or right from the editor.
- Title fonts: Bebas Neue, Oswald, Playfair Display, Cinzel, and Space
  Grotesk (free Google fonts, system fallback when offline).
- Themes go deeper: each theme now tints panels, chips, and progress tracks,
  and the accent glows through the title and progress bar.

### Feel

- Saves reach the Hub in ~2 seconds — the card polls settings on a fast
  loop instead of waiting for the next now-playing cycle.
- Template picker cards show real screenshots of each layout.
- The demo movie now includes a title logo, so the clear-logo look
  (pulled from Plex metadata on real playback) is visible in the preview.

## 1.2.0 — 2026-07-07

### Device discovery

- The settings page now finds Google Cast devices on your LAN (mDNS via
  `catt scan`) — press Scan and pick your Hub from a dropdown instead of
  typing an IP. `HUB_IP` remains as an env fallback and is no longer
  required, so the container starts fine before a device is chosen.

### Cleanup

- Removed one-time repo bootstrap scripts.
- `PLEX_HOST` defaults to `http://localhost:32400`; field descriptions now
  explain why `PAGE_URL` must be a LAN IP the Hub can reach.

## 1.1.0 — 2026-07-06

### Templates

- Rebuilt the card around self-contained blocks (title/logo identity, grouped
  ratings, metadata chips, plot, progress, clock, poster) and added five
  hand-designed templates that arrange them into genuinely different
  compositions: Spotlight, Split, Hero, Lower Third, and Big Clock.
- Template picker in settings with sketch thumbnails and instant live preview —
  changes preview in the demo frame without touching the Hub until saved.

### Customization

- Custom accent color picker alongside the four themes.
- Clock styles: 12/24-hour format and optional seconds.
- Block editor now moves and resizes whole blocks: position, width, and a new
  size control; every block can be shown or hidden independently.

### UI

- Release notes moved into a slide-over panel ("What's new") instead of a
  page-bottom section.
- Demo art is embedded in the card, so the settings preview always renders
  fully even before anything has played.

### Fixes

- New `PLEX_USERS` setting limits which Plex users trigger the marquee.
  Previously any session on the server — including shared and home users —
  would take over the Hub.
- Metadata strings are now HTML-escaped on the card, so titles or ratings
  containing &, <, or quotes render correctly.

## 1.0.1 — 2026-07-06

### Reliability

- Fixed a crash loop on first start when `/config` is a host-owned bind mount
  (e.g. Unraid appdata, which arrives root-owned): the container now starts as
  root, chowns `/config` to the `marquee` user via an entrypoint, then drops
  privileges with `su-exec` before running the app. No more manual `chmod` on
  the appdata folder.

## 1.0.0 — 2026-07-05

### Features

- Initial Marquee release with Plex session polling, artwork, metadata, scores,
  progress, clock, poster/backdrop layouts, themes, and Google Nest Hub casting.
- Added one-click presets for minimal, clock-focused, poster wall, cinema, and
  dusk presentation styles.
- Added snap-grid move and width-resize controls in the live preview.
- Added persistent container settings under `/config`.

### Reliability

- Hardened container publishing so Docker Hub login is only used when
  credentials are present.
- Kept the cast workflow on current GitHub Actions releases.
- Added explicit Cast command error logging and retry behavior.

### Documentation

- Added a polished public README, screenshots, and version-history links.
- Removed internal Unraid/template setup language from the public docs.
- Kept the release notes visible in the settings panel for quick review.

### Notes

- Added explicit versioning and a clean container/Compose deployment path.
