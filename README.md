Marquee turns a Google Nest Hub into a clean now-playing display for Plex, Emby, or Jellyfin. It shows artwork, title, plot, genres, ratings, media details, progress, and a clock, then returns the Hub to ambient mode when playback stops.

> ### 📺 This fork adds ESP32 panel support
>
> This is [TRusselo's fork](https://github.com/TRusselo/marquee-esp32). On top of everything upstream, it adds an **optional way to show the now-playing card on an ESP32 touch panel** (e.g. an Elecrow CrowPanel 7") running [ESPHome](https://esphome.io) — no Nest Hub required.
>
> It's a **decoupled add-on**: it talks to Marquee only over HTTP, so it runs against *any* Marquee (including the upstream image) and needs **no fork of the app itself**.
>
> - **`marquee-shot` sidecar** — a small container that renders Marquee's real card with headless Chromium and serves it as a flat image, so the panel shows the **pixel-perfect** card. Published at `ghcr.io/trusselo/marquee-shot`. → **[sidecar/README.md](sidecar/README.md)**
> - **ESPHome panel configs** — the CrowPanel screenshot-mode config, plus on-device (no-sidecar) example configs that reconstruct the card on the ESP. → **[esphome/README.md](esphome/README.md)**
> - **Enable it** per platform: an Unraid Community Applications template ([`unraid/marquee-shot.xml`](unraid/marquee-shot.xml)), a plain `docker run`, or the Compose `panel` profile. **[sidecar/README.md](sidecar/README.md)**
>
> Everything else in this README is upstream Marquee, unchanged — run it exactly as documented below and add the panel on top.

## ESP32 Enhanced v4

This source package keeps the fork's `marquee-shot` and CrowPanel/ESPHome
support, and adds five optional Designer blocks: **Viewer**, **Device**,
**Stream**, **Active streams**, and **Audio & subtitles**. They expose the active user and rotation
position, playback client/device, Direct Play/Direct Stream/Transcoding path,
resolution/HDR/bitrate, and selected tracks where the media server reports
them. Version 2 makes the session cards equal-height and lets each card hide its
background and border independently. Version 3 adds a Local/Remote label switch
to Device and a server-wide count of streams currently in progress. The
movie/show **Title** and **Category**
are separate movable blocks, and the font picker now includes fifteen typefaces
plus the theme default.

Backdrop editing also accepts a persistent custom JPEG, PNG, or WebP image.
It can cover, contain, or stretch to the frame, with independent zoom, focus,
opacity, blur, and brightness controls. The uploaded file stays in `/config`.
The Design preview now defaults to the CrowPanel's native **800 × 480** and can
preview Google Nest Hub, Nest Hub Max, 16:9, 4:3, or custom viewport sizes.
Street has a separate rain-animation switch, and Credits Badge can be removed
or added from the normal block chips. Version 4 also turns Street's poster-light
frame and NOW PLAYING sign into independently movable blocks. Title logo art is
centered inside a bounded box, automatically trims transparent padding, and has
contain/width/natural fit plus 50–200% zoom controls.

For the CrowPanel screenshot workflow, this package's sidecar also detects
changes to those fields and immediately publishes a new `card.jpg`. Build the
local sidecar rather than using the original published image:

```sh
# version 4
docker compose --profile panel up -d --build
```

See [`ENHANCEMENTS.md`](ENHANCEMENTS.md) for upgrade and validation details.

![Marquee — Street template](https://github.com/Jamisonfitz/marquee/releases/download/v2.2.1/street.jpg)

*Seven templates, per-block colors and fonts, every block movable — your setup will not look like anyone else's.*

## Templates

Seven layouts, switchable live from the settings page:

| | |
|:---:|:---:|
| ![Spotlight](https://github.com/Jamisonfitz/marquee/releases/download/v2.2.1/spotlight.jpg) **Spotlight** — poster beside the full metadata stack | ![Hero](https://github.com/Jamisonfitz/marquee/releases/download/v2.2.1/hero.jpg) **Hero** — big centered title over the backdrop |
| ![Lower Third](https://github.com/Jamisonfitz/marquee/releases/download/v2.2.1/lowerthird.jpg) **Lower Third** — broadcast-style chyron over full-bleed art | ![Big Clock](https://github.com/Jamisonfitz/marquee/releases/download/v2.2.1/bigclock.jpg) **Big Clock** — ambient timepiece with a now-playing strip |
| ![Street](https://github.com/Jamisonfitz/marquee/releases/download/v2.2.1/street.jpg) **Street** — a living night scene: your poster in a bulb-lit marquee, the logo sprayed on brick, real weather on the wall | ![Split](https://github.com/Jamisonfitz/marquee/releases/download/v2.2.1/split.jpg) **Split** — hard split: full-height art wall beside the info column |
| ![Fanart](https://github.com/Jamisonfitz/marquee/releases/download/v2.2.1/fanart.jpg) **Fanart** — fanart.tv artwork rotating on a blank canvas; add only the blocks you want (free API key required) | |

Every template is built from the same set of blocks — backdrop, clock, weather,
category, title, metadata, plot, ratings, progress, poster, viewer, device,
stream, active streams, audio/subtitles, and credits badge — and every block carries its
own position, size, font, and color per template, so a nudge in Spotlight
never moves anything in Street.

## The settings page is the card

Settings v3 has no wall of options. The card fills the page; you edit what
you're looking at.

![Settings v2 — the card is the page](https://github.com/Jamisonfitz/marquee/releases/download/v2.2.1/settings-design.jpg)

- **Tap anything.** Tap a block on the live preview — or its chip below — and
  the editor shows just that block's controls: font, color, position, width,
  size, plus whatever it owns (clock style and seconds, weather effects and
  intensity, panel background/border, logo art vs text title). Tap the card's
  empty background to upload, crop, zoom, and style a custom backdrop.
- **Preview the real target.** CrowPanel 800×480 is the default, with presets
  for both Nest Hub sizes, 16:9, 4:3, and custom pixel dimensions.
- **The chips tell the truth.** One pill per block on the card: × takes it
  off, "+ Add" brings anything back. When a block is on your card but has
  nothing to show for the current title — no scores yet, an emptied metadata
  line — its chip goes dim and the editor says so, instead of letting you
  adjust an element that isn't on screen.
- **Bottle a look, share it, credit travels.** "Save preset" snapshots your
  whole layout onto the template carousel. "Share this look" copies it as a
  small setup file — credited to you — and anyone who imports it gets it on
  their carousel tagged with your name, one tap from applied. Locations and
  credentials never ride along.
- **A guided tour, once.** First run walks you through the six things that
  matter, spotlighting the real interface — then gets out of the way.
- **Phones are first-class.** The preview pins to the top at a size that
  leaves room to work, and the on-screen keyboard can never cover it.

## Features

- Live now-playing card from Plex, Emby, or Jellyfin; casts to a Nest Hub
  and hands it back to ambient mode when playback stops.
- Seven templates, including Street (animated night scene with rain, snow,
  smoke-fog, and storms that follow your real weather, intensity 1–4) and
  Fanart (rotating fanart.tv art on a blank canvas).
- Every block — clock, weather, title, plot, ratings, progress, poster, viewer,
  device, stream, active streams, audio/subtitles, and credits badge —
  addable, removable, and movable per template, each with its own font and
  color. Tap it on the live preview to edit it.
- Presets and "Share this look": snapshot a layout, or export it as a small
  credited file others import in one tap. Credentials never ride along.
- Session filters (users, devices, a "do not cast" word list) and rotation
  when multiple sessions play.
- A six-step guided tour on first run; settings persist in `/config`;
  `/healthz` for monitoring.

## What You Need

- Docker
- A Plex, Emby, or Jellyfin server on the same LAN
- A Google Nest Hub on the same LAN
- A Plex `X-Plex-Token` (or an Emby / Jellyfin API key)

Marquee is designed for a trusted LAN. It has no login and should not be port-forwarded.

## Quick Start

Edit the example IP addresses and token in `compose.yaml`, then run:

```sh
docker compose up -d --build
docker compose logs -f marquee
```

Open `http://SERVER-IP:8084/`. The card served to the Hub is `http://SERVER-IP:8084/image`.

If you prefer plain Docker:

```sh
docker build -t marquee:local .
docker run -d --name marquee --restart unless-stopped --network host \
  -e PAGE_URL=http://192.168.1.10:8084/image \
  -e PLEX_HOST=http://localhost:32400 \
  -e PLEX_TOKEN=replace-me \
  -v marquee-config:/config \
  marquee:local
```

Settings persist under `./data` in Compose mode or `/config` in the container.

## Configuration

Required environment variables:

- `PAGE_URL` — this server's LAN IP + `/image`. The Hub loads this URL, so
  `localhost` will not work here.
- `PLEX_HOST` — keep `http://localhost:32400` when Plex runs on the same
  machine; otherwise its LAN IP
- `PLEX_TOKEN`

### Choosing the media backend

Plex is the default. Marquee can poll an **Emby** or **Jellyfin** server
instead — same card, same settings, same filters. Pick it on the settings
page (*Media server* panel: backend dropdown + address + key; each backend
keeps its own stored pair, changes apply ~5s after Save, no restart), or via
env: `MEDIA_BACKEND=emby` with `EMBY_HOST`/`EMBY_API_KEY`, or
`MEDIA_BACKEND=jellyfin` with `JELLYFIN_HOST`/`JELLYFIN_API_KEY`.
Keys and tokens are write-only: stored server-side, never sent back to a
browser, never in Export. Only `PAGE_URL` is required at startup — a
container with no credentials boots to the settings page. Verified against
Emby 4.9 and Jellyfin 10.11.

Cast device: open the settings page and press **Scan** — Marquee discovers
Google Cast devices on your LAN and you pick your Hub from a dropdown.
(`HUB_IP` still works as an env fallback; discovery needs the container on
the same network/VLAN as the Hub, which host networking gives you.)

Optional settings:

- `PLEX_USERS` — comma-separated Plex usernames that trigger the marquee.
  Leave empty to react to everyone on the server, including shared and home
  users (the sessions API is server-wide).
- `PLEX_DEVICES` — comma-separated player/device names that trigger the
  marquee; empty allows any device. Both filters are also editable live on
  the settings page, which shows the exact names of active sessions.
- `BLOCK_TAGS` — comma-separated **do-not-cast** words checked against each
  session's genres, tags, and content rating (e.g. `adult, xxx, 18+, nc-17,
  tv-ma`); a match is never cast. Case-insensitive; words of 3+ characters
  match inside terms, shorter ones match exactly. Also on the settings page.

When more than one allowed session is playing, each takes the display in turn.
**Rotate between sessions** on the settings page sets how long each gets
(default 30 seconds; 0 pins the first, ordered by user then device). Sessions
are always sorted before one is picked, so the card never flips at random
because the server reordered its session list.
- `TMDB_API_KEY` — enables the credits-scene badge
- `FANART_API_KEY` — container default for the Fanart template's key
  (the settings page value wins)
- `POLL_SECONDS` default `5`
- `SERVE_PORT` default `8084`
- `REPO_DIR` — the container sets `/app` (the code's own default is `/repo`)
- `DATA_DIR` — the container sets `/config` (the code's own default is
  `REPO_DIR/output`)

### Env vars are defaults, not overrides

Some settings exist both as env vars and on the settings page. They all follow
one rule:

| Setting | Env var | Settings page | How they combine |
|---|---|---|---|
| Cast device | `HUB_IP` | Cast device picker | The settings page **wins**; the env var is the default when no device has been picked. |
| Users | `PLEX_USERS` | Plex users | Same rule: a typed list **replaces** the env var; a blank field inherits it. |
| Devices | `PLEX_DEVICES` | Devices | Same rule. |
| Do not cast | `BLOCK_TAGS` | Do not cast | Same rule. |

The settings page shows each inherited env value as a greyed placeholder —
`jamison (from PLEX_USERS)` — so a blank field reads as *inheriting this*
rather than *nothing is set*, and typing a value (then clearing it later)
behaves the way you'd expect. The placeholders come from `/env-defaults`,
which serves those values and nothing else — an allowlist, so nothing
credential-shaped can leak to a browser.

Health status is available at `/healthz` and includes the version.

## Plex Token

1. Sign in to Plex Web and open an item on your server.
2. Select **More (`…`) → Get Info → View XML**.
3. Copy the value after `X-Plex-Token=` from the browser address bar.
4. Test it at `http://PLEX-IP:32400/?X-Plex-Token=YOUR_TOKEN`.

See Plex's [token instructions](https://support.plex.tv/articles/204059436-finding-an-authentication-token-x-plex-token/).
Never put a real token in Compose files, screenshots, issues, or commits.

For credits-scene badges, create a TMDb account, open **Account Settings → API**, request a key, and set `TMDB_API_KEY`.

## Tips

**Silence the cast chime.** Every time Marquee takes over the display, the
Nest Hub plays its connect sound. That chime comes from the device, not from
Marquee, and there's a switch for it: open the **Google Home** app → tap
your Hub → **Settings (gear) → Accessibility** → turn off **Play sounds on
start/end of casting**. One-time change; casting is silent afterwards.

## Community Forks & Related Projects

- [TRusselo's fork](https://github.com/TRusselo/marquee) — exploring Emby
  support, ESP32/ESPHome displays, Home Assistant integration, and vertical
  poster views. Independent project, not maintained or supported here, but
  worth a look if that's your stack.

## Development

```sh
docker build -t marquee:test .
docker run --rm marquee:test python cast/cast.py --selftest
docker logs -f marquee
```

The service uses [catt](https://github.com/skorokithakis/catt) to launch DashCast on the Hub. Ratings come from Plex metadata; optional credits-scene keywords come from TMDb.

### Cast behavior

Marquee checks that DashCast is active, casts the `/image` URL when playback starts, and releases the Hub when playback stops. Container tests cannot prove physical Hub behavior, so before publishing a release:

1. Open `PAGE_URL` from another LAN device.
2. Start a Plex movie or episode and confirm the Hub loads the card.
3. Pause and resume playback and confirm the progress state updates within one poll interval.
4. Stop playback and confirm the Hub returns to ambient mode.
5. Review `docker logs marquee`; there should be no `catt ... failed` message.

## Credits

Marquee stands on generous shoulders:

- **[TRusselo](https://github.com/TRusselo)** — the Emby & Jellyfin backends,
  session filters and rotation, the dead-card heartbeat, the content filter,
  and a steady stream of sharp fixes.
- **[catt](https://github.com/skorokithakis/catt)** by Stavros Korokithakis —
  the casting engine that actually puts the card on your Hub (BSD, bundled
  stock).
- The Street template's weather effects adapt open CodePen techniques by
  sheepjs, Ivan Odintsov, Braeden Craig, and Tiff Wong — full notes and
  sources in [CREDITS.md](CREDITS.md).
